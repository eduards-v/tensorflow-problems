## Iris problems

Original problem set https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/tensorflow.html

### 1. Use Tensorflow to create model

Use Tensorflow to create a model to predict the species of Iris from a flowerâ€™s sepal width, sepal length, petal width, and petal length.

### 2. Split the data into training and testing

Split the data set into a training set and a testing set. You should investigate the best way to do this, and list any online references used in your notebook. If you wish to, you can write some code to randomly separate the data on the fly.

### 3. Train the model

Use the training set to train your model.

### 4. Test the model 

Use the testing set to test your model, clearly calculating and displaying the error rate.
